# Jarvis-in-Python
Created a Python program with an AI foundation.
This project is based on the film Iron Man, in which the lead character makes use of Jarvis, an AI program. These are some of its features.
• The movie's GIF is displayed at the beginning, music is played, and then a password request is made.
To function, this program relies on voice recognition.
• After that, if we say wake up, it turns on and wishes us good morning or afternoon based on the time.
• There are more than 25 features in this, some of which include: telling the time, setting an alarm, setting reminders, and performing an internet search (including Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, and many others) when the command is said.
• This program has a calculator, can tell us the weather, can play, pause, increase, or decrease the volume of a video, can schedule the day and upon request tells us the schedule, can send an email on our behalf without using a browser, can send WhatsApp messages if web. Whatsapp is linked and can open computer programs like Word and Excel.
• Even when minimized, this program continues to listen and respond appropriately. It also sleeps in response to the command "sleep now."
• To enable this program to run without an IDE, I created an .exe file.
I keep on adding functions to this program from time to time to update this.
